<P>
This program carries out unrooted parsimony (analogous to Wagner
trees) (Eck and Dayhoff, 1966; Kluge and Farris, 1969) on DNA
sequences.  The method of Fitch (1971) is used to count the number of
changes of base needed on a given tree.
The assumptions of this method are analogous to those of MIX:
<OL>
<LI>Each site evolves independently.
<LI>Different lineages evolve independently.
<LI>The probability of a base substitution at a given site is
small over the lengths of time involved in
a branch of the phylogeny.
<LI>The expected amounts of change in different branches of the phylogeny
do not vary by so much that two changes in a high-rate branch
are more probable than one change in a low-rate branch.
<LI>The expected amounts of change do not vary enough among sites that two
changes in one site are more probable than one change in another.
</OL>
<P>
That these are the assumptions of parsimony methods has been documented
in a series of papers of mine: (1973a, 1978b, 1979, 1981b, 1983b, 1988b).  For
an opposing view arguing that the parsimony methods make no substantive 
assumptions such as these, see the papers by Farris (1983) and Sober (1983a, 
1983b, 1988), but also read the exchange between Felsenstein and Sober (1986).  
<P>
Change from an occupied site to a deletion is counted as one
change.  Reversion from a deletion to an occupied site is allowed and is also
counted as one change.  Note that this in effect assumes that a deletion
N bases long is N separate events.
<P>
Dnapars can handle both bifurcating and multifurcating trees.  In doing its
search for most parsimonious trees, it adds species not only by creating new
forks in the middle of existing branches, but it also tries putting them at
the end of new branches which are added to existing forks.  Thus it searches
among both bifurcating and multifurcating trees.  If a branch in a tree
does not have any characters which might change in that branch in the most
parsimonious tree, it does not save that tree.  Thus in any tree that
results, a branch exists only if some character has a most parsimonious
reconstruction that would involve change in that branch.
<P>
It also saves a number of trees tied for best (you can alter the number
it saves using the V option in the menu).  When rearranging trees, it
tries rearrangements of all of the saved trees.  This makes the algorithm
slower than earlier versions of Dnapars.
<P>
The input data is standard.  The first line of the input file contains the
number of species and the number of sites.
<P>
Next come the species data.  Each
sequence starts on a new line, has a ten-character species name
that must be blank-filled to be of that length, followed immediately
by the species data in the one-letter code.  The sequences must either
be in the "interleaved" or "sequential" formats
described in the Molecular Sequence Programs document.  The I option
selects between them.  The sequences can have internal 
blanks in the sequence but there must be no extra blanks at the end of the 
terminated line.  Note that a blank is not a valid symbol for a deletion.
<P>
The options are selected using an interactive menu.  The menu looks like this:

<P>
The user either types "Y" (followed, of course, by a carriage-return)
if the settings shown are to be accepted, or the letter or digit corresponding
to an option that is to be changed.
<P>
The N option allows you to choose transversion parsimony, which counts only
transversions (changes between one of the purines A or G and one of the
pyrimidines C or T).  This setting is turned off by default.
<P>
The Weights (W) option
takes the weights from a file whose default name is "weights".  The weights
follow the format described in the main documentation file, with integer
weights from 0 to 35 allowed by using the characters 0, 1, 2, ..., 9 and
A, B, ... Z.
<P>
The User tree (option U) is read from a file whose default name is "intree".
The trees can be multifurcating. They must be preceded in the file by a
line giving the number of trees in the file.
<P>
The options J, O, T, M, and 0 are the usual ones.  They are described in the
main documentation file of this package.  Option I is the same as in
other molecular sequence programs and is described in the documentation file
for the sequence programs.
<P>
The M (multiple data sets option) will ask you whether you want to
use multiple sets of weights (from the weights file) or multiple data sets.
The ability to use a single data set with multiple weights means that
much less disk space will be used for this input data.  The bootstrapping
and jackknifing tool Seqboot has the ability to create a weights file with
multiple weights.
<P>
The O (outgroup) option will have no effect if the U (user-defined tree)
option is in effect.
The T (threshold) option allows a continuum of methods 
between parsimony and compatibility.  Thresholds less than or equal to 1.0 do 
not have any meaning and should
not be used: they will result in a tree dependent only on the input
order of species and not at all on the data!
<P>
Output is standard: if option 1 is toggled on, the data is printed out,
with the convention that "." means "the same as in the first species".
Then comes a list of equally parsimonious trees.
Each tree has branch lengths.  These are computed using an algorithm
published by Hochbaum and Pathria (1997) which I first heard of from
Wayne Maddison who invented it independently of them.  This algorithm
averages the number of reconstructed changes of state over all sites a
over all possible most parsimonious placements of the changes of state
among branches.  Note that it does not correct in any way for multiple
changes that overlay each other.
<P>
If option 2 is
toggled on a table of the 
number of changes of state required in each character is also
printed.  If option 5 is toggled 
on, a table is printed 
out after each tree, showing for each  branch whether there are known to be 
changes in the branch, and what the states are inferred to have been at the 
top end of the branch.  This is a reconstruction of the ancestral sequences
in the tree.  If you choose option 5, a menu item D appears which gives you
the opportunity to turn off dot-differencing so that complete ancestral
sequences are shown.  If the inferred state is a "?" or one of the IUB
ambiguity symbols, there will be multiple 
equally-parsimonious assignments of states; the user must work these out for 
themselves by hand.  A "?" in the reconstructed states means that in
addition to one or more bases, a deletion may or may not be present.  If
option 6 is left in its default state the trees
found will be written to a tree file, so that they are available to be used
in other programs.
<P>
If the U (User Tree) option is used and more than one tree is supplied, the
program also performs a statistical test of each of these trees against the
best tree.  This test, which is a version of the test proposed by
Alan Templeton (1983) and evaluated in a test case by me (1985a).  It is
closely parallel to a test using log likelihood differences
due to Kishino and Hasegawa (1989), and
uses the mean and variance of 
step differences between trees, taken across sites.  If the mean
is more than 1.96 standard deviations different then the trees are declared
significantly different.  The program
prints out a table of the steps for each tree, the differences of
each from the best one, the variance of that quantity as determined by
the step differences at individual sites, and a conclusion as to
whether that tree is or is not significantly worse than the best one.
<P>
Option 6 in the menu controls whether the tree estimated by the program
is written onto a tree file.  The default name of this output tree file
is "outtree".  If the U option is in effect, all the user-defined
trees are written to the output tree file.
<P>
The program is a straightforward relative of MIX
and runs reasonably quickly, especially with many sites and few species.
